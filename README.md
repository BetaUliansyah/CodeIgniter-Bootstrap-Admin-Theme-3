#### [CodeIgniter Sunrise](https://github.com/sjlu/CodeIgniter-Sunrise) has a LESS and JS compiler for better dependency management.

## Introduction

CodeIgniter Bootstrap kick starts the development process of the web development process by including Twitter Bootstrap into CodeIgniter. It also includes certain libraries such as AWS and Facebook in-case you are developing applications requiring those SDKs. So stop writing the same code over again and start working on your idea.

CodeIgniter Bootstrap follows the path where it lazy loads libraries. Though the project footprint may be large, the memory footprint will still be extremely light. Try not to autoload libraries as it does not follow the CodeIgniter convention (though some libraries do make sense to autoload).

## Installation

Derived from CodeIgniter, read [CodeIgniter Installation](http://codeigniter.com/user_guide/installation/index.html) for how to install using this [zipball](https://github.com/sjlu/CodeIgniter-Bootstrap/zipball/master) instead. If you're not familiar with CodeIgniter, I suggest reading the [CodeIgniter Tutorial](http://codeigniter.com/user_guide/tutorial/index.html) on how to get started and read the [wiki](https://github.com/sjlu/CodeIgniter-Bootstrap/wiki) for more information.

## Flavors

* The `master` branch contains the original and includes [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/) and [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/).
* The `cdn` branch contains the same libraries but is hosted by [BootstrapCDN](http://www.bootstrapcdn.com/).
