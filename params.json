{"name":"CodeIgniter-Bootstrap-Admin-Theme-3","tagline":"","body":"CodeIgniter-Bootstrap-Admin-Theme-3\r\n===================================\r\n\r\n## Introduction\r\n\r\nCodeIgniter Bootstrap Admin Theme 3 combines [Bootstrap Admin Theme 3](https://github.com/VinceG/Bootstrap-Admin-Theme-3) by VinceG and [CodeIgniter-Bootstrap](https://github.com/sjlu/CodeIgniter-Bootstrap) by Steven Lu into one new project. Hopefully, it can help you to get into your development phase faster. \r\n\r\nAnd I'm sorry for the long namespace. It's such kind of waste :P\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nDerived from CodeIgniter, read [CodeIgniter Installation](http://codeigniter.com/user_guide/installation/index.html) for how to install using this [zipball](https://github.com/BetaUliansyah/CodeIgniter-Bootstrap-Admin-Theme-3/archive/master.zip) instead. If [CodeIgniter Tutorial](http://codeigniter.com/user_guide/tutorial/index.html) confused you (like I did), you might want to read this [easy introduction to CI] (https://speakerdeck.com/sluzorz/lesson-1) for more information.\r\n\r\n## Flavors\r\n\r\n* The `master` branch contains the original and includes [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/) and [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/).\r\n* The `cdn` branch contains the same libraries but is hosted by [BootstrapCDN](http://www.bootstrapcdn.com/).\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\nNot available yet. Contribution to our [wiki](https://github.com/BetaUliansyah/CodeIgniter-Bootstrap-Admin-Theme-3/wiki) is welcome and appreciated.\r\n\r\n## Releases\r\n\r\nThis is currently a very active project, there are no projected release locks planned. All changes will be latest in master and may be unstable.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nMIT with [CodeIgniter Amendments](http://codeigniter.com/user_guide/license.html)\r\n\r\nCodeIgniter-Bootstrap-Admin-Theme-3\r\n===================================\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
