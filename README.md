CodeIgniter-Bootstrap-Admin-Theme-3
===================================

## Introduction

CodeIgniter Bootstrap Admin Theme 3 combines [Bootstrap Admin Theme 3](https://github.com/VinceG/Bootstrap-Admin-Theme-3) by VinceG and [CodeIgniter-Bootstrap](https://github.com/sjlu/CodeIgniter-Bootstrap) by Steven Lu into one new project. Hopefully, it can help you to get into your development phase faster. 

And I'm sorry for the long namespace. It's such kind of waste :P

## Installation

Derived from CodeIgniter, read [CodeIgniter Installation](http://codeigniter.com/user_guide/installation/index.html) for how to install using this [zipball](https://github.com/BetaUliansyah/CodeIgniter-Bootstrap-Admin-Theme-3/archive/master.zip) instead. If [CodeIgniter Tutorial](http://codeigniter.com/user_guide/tutorial/index.html) confused you (like I did), you might want to read this [easy introduction to CI] (https://speakerdeck.com/sluzorz/lesson-1) for more information.

## Flavors

* The `master` branch contains the original and includes [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/) and [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/).
* The `cdn` branch contains the same libraries but is hosted by [BootstrapCDN](http://www.bootstrapcdn.com/).
